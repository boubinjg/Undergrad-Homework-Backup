This is the README file for Project 2.
The purpose of this project is to create a program to execute Prims and Dijkstras 
Algorithms on a graph. The program takes as input one graph of this format:

The first line contains the exact number of nodes in the graph
The second line contains the name of those edges
The remaining lines contain the adjacency matrix with integers signifying the weight of an edge from 
one vertex to another. Weights of 0 signify no connection.

Example Graph:
4
A B C D
0 1 0 1 
1 0 2 5 
0 2 0 0
1 5 0 0


This graph contains 4 nodes: A B C and D
and 4 edges: A-B (1), A-D (1), B-C (2) and B-D (5)

To execute the program, first build it with the makefile, creating the proj2 executable
After executing proj2, you will be prompted to enter the name of a file which contains
a graph as specified above. 
The program will then ask for you to specify two vertices in the graph, for example A and B from the above graph.
The program will first see if they are connected. If they are connected it will output the
least cost to move from one to the other. It will then output the least cost path.

Finally the program will output the minimum spanning tree of the graph.


Assumptions:

This program assumes that -

-graphs are connected
-graphs are input in the correct format
-graphs are not directed, meaning the cost from A to B is the cost from B to A
